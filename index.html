<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is -good design-?</h2>
      <h3>I think objectively good design acts as a subtle prod at the our sense of novelty, gradually pushing our horizons of how design, aesthetic, and enviroment can present themselves to us, meeting efficiency in the middle. <br> <br>Design can evoke in the observer near-ineffable reflections and emotions; stirring in the consumer their own personal experiences and frame of reference, and that power is vested in even the most banal picture or product, whispering in the language only art can speak, beckoning you to examine both yourself and the work. </h3>
      <h3>With that being said! The real mettle of design is its ability to compromise to the context and user it conversely finds itself confronted with - and how can that spirit of novely persist while making adjustments for usability, accessiblity, and practicality? <br><br>No insights of value are gleamed solely from talking at another, a conversation is much better - people may not be willing to adapt their usability habits to avant-garde or indulgent design, so how can we integrate these qualities into their daily life, gently pushing at the constraints placed around our sense of novelty.   </h3>

      <h3>Ostensibly, I would like to go into user experience or technical writing, living a meager professional life until I get to retire upstate to sketch birds. <br><br> But regardless of what I occupy myself with in the day-to-day, what will really change?
